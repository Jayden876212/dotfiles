Locking the front door won’t stop the most determined folks from getting inside, especially if you’ve left the back door and windows unlocked and an extra key under the doormat. That’s why we offer multiple types of privacy protection, most of which aren’t offered in most popular browsers by default.\n\nWith the press of a button, you get seamless protection from most 3rd-party trackers while you search and browse, access to tracking protections for emails you receive, and much more. Together these privacy essentials make more privacy your default.\n\nFEATURE HIGHLIGHTS\n\n    Search Privately by Default — DuckDuckGo Private Search comes built-in, so you can easily search the web without being tracked.\n    Escape Website Trackers Before They Load — automatically stop most hidden trackers (3rd-party scripts) from loading, which prevents companies from collecting and using (e.g. sale, ads, etc.) any data from these trackers. Our cutting-edge tracker blocking technology – called 3rd-Party Tracker Loading Protection – goes well above and beyond what you get in most popular browsers by default.\n    Automatically Enforce Encryption — force many sites you visit to automatically use an encrypted (HTTPS) connection, which helps shield your data from Wi-Fi snoopers and network onlookers like your Internet provider. Most popular browsers only direct users to encrypted versions of pages in specific circumstances, like when you navigate directly to a page in the address bar. We check our list of upgradable sites for all links you click.\n    Enable Built-in Email Protection — Over 85% of emails sent to Duck Addresses contained trackers that can detect when you’ve opened a message, where you were when you opened it, and what device you were using. Email Protection makes it easy to block most email trackers and hide your existing address when signing up for things online, all without switching email providers.\n    Escape Fingerprinting — help stop companies from creating a unique identifier for you by blocking their attempts to combine specific information about your browser and device settings.\n    Block Tracking Cookies— prevent most 3rd-party cookies from tracking you as you browse from site to site.\n\n\nADDITIONAL PROTECTIONS NOT AVAILABLE ON MOST BROWSERS\n\n    Link Tracking Protection — helps stop companies from gathering your browsing history and other information via personal identifiers embedded in the links you click on.\n    Embedded Social Content Tracking Protection — blocks embedded Facebook content around the web so they can't track you through their videos, posts, and comments found on other sites. You can easily unblock to view them if desired.\n    Google AMP Protection — forces sites to load content directly from publishers instead of using Google-owned links, which are full of creepy trackers.\n    Signal Your Privacy Preference with Global Privacy Control (GPC) — built-into our app, GPC intends to help you express your opt-out rights automatically by telling websites not to sell or share your personal information. Whether it can be used to enforce your legal rights (for example, current or future CCPA, GDPR requirements) depends on the laws in your jurisdiction.\n\n\nNote about our 3rd-Party Tracker Loading Protection following DuckDuckGo ad clicks: Our 3rd-Party Tracker Protection goes above and beyond what you get in most popular browsers by default, but we’re constantly working to make it more comprehensive. Currently, if an advertiser wants to detect conversions on their own website for our private DuckDuckGo search ads, our 3rd-Party Tracker Loading Protection will not stop bat.bing.com requests from loading on the advertiser’s website following DuckDuckGo ad clicks, but those requests are stopped in all other contexts. This is because DuckDuckGo private search advertising is in partnership with Microsoft. As part of that partnership, viewing ads on DuckDuckGo is anonymous and Microsoft has committed to not profile our users’ ad clicks.\n\nRead more about this and our Tracking Protections at https://help.duckduckgo.com/privacy/web-tracking-protections/\n\nYou don't need to wait to take back your privacy. Join the millions of people using DuckDuckGo and protect many of your everyday online activities with one app. It's privacy, simplified.\n\nAbout Us: https://duckduckgo.com/about/\nHow It Works: https://duckduckgo.com/app\nPrivacy Newsletter: https://duckduckgo.com/newsletter\nPrivacy Policy: https://duckduckgo.com/privacy/\nTerms of Service: https://duckduckgo.com/terms/\nOpen Source: https://github.com/duckduckgo/duckduckgo-privacy-extension","weeklyDownloads":6318,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"DuckDuckGo","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/3946396/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/307/307997.png?modified=1730489466","width":2400,"height":1500,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/307/307997.jpg?modified=1730489466","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":333},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/308/308000.png?modified=1730489469","width":2400,"height":1500,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/308/308000.jpg?modified=1730489469","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":333},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/307/307998.png?modified=1730489460","width":2400,"height":1500,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/307/307998.jpg?modified=1730489460","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":333},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/307/307999.png?modified=1730489473","width":2400,"height":1500,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/307/307999.jpg?modified=1730489473","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":333},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/308/308001.png?modified=1730489473","width":2400,"height":1500,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/308/308001.jpg?modified=1730489473","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":333}],"contributionURL":"","averageRating":4.3448,"reviewCount":644,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/duckduckgo-for-firefox/reviews/","updateDate":1730298452000},{"id":"addon@darkreader.org","icons":{"32":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/855/855413-32.png?modified=3f34e276","64":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/855/855413-64.png?modified=3f34e276","128":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/855/855413-128.png?modified=3f34e276"},"name":"Dark Reader","version":"4.9.99","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/4405074/darkreader-4.9.99.xpi","homepageURL":"https://darkreader.org/","supportURL":"https://github.com/darkreader/darkreader","amoListingURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/darkreader/","description":"Dark mode for every website.

If it's unnecessary, you can remove it from the toolbar.\n\n\nPermissions:\n\nThis extension needs following permissions to work as expected:\n\n    Required:\n        Access browser tabs: to list both active and non-active tabs in the UI.\n        Access recently closed tabs (access to the session information): to save tree information of tabs (structure, collapsed/expanded state, etc.) to tabs' session information and ask to Firefox to manage them as bundled.\n        Display notifications to you: to present information and navigate users without blocking.\n    Optional:\n        Read and modify bookmarks: to simulate bookmark related commands in the tab context menu. / to detect tabs whether they were opened from bookmarks or not.\n        Access your data for all websites (run scripts on webpages): to detect the Ctrl key is pressed/released and prevent needless expansion of collapsed trees while tab switching with Ctrl-Tab/Ctrl-Shift-Tab.\n        Hide and show browser tabs: just for automated tests, not required on regular use.\n\n\nExtensions extend TST:\n\nTST provides APIs for other extensions.\nSome extemsopms extend the behavior of TST's sidebar panel:\n\n    Multiple Tab Handler allows you to select multiple tabs with long-press on tabs. It also allows you to close mutiple tabs with long-press on the closebox on tabs.\n    TST Active Tab in Collapsed Tree shows a small tab on a collapsed tree as an alias for the last active tab under the tree.\n    TST Auto Group Tabs provides ability to group newly opened tabs automatically in various conditions.\n    TST Auto Sticky Tabs provides ability to stick some state tabs to tab bar edges automatically.\n    TST Bookmarks Subpanel allows you to show a small \"Bookmarks\" sidebar panel below tabs in the TST's sidebar.\n    TST Lock Tree Collapsed allows you to lock arbitrary trees as collapsed. (This was a built-in feature on TST 3.3.0-3.3.6, and now separated.)\n    TST Indent Line provides indent lines like Visual Studio Code's one.\n\n\nAnd there are more helper extensions.","weeklyDownloads":5043,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"Piro (piro_or)","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/9480/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/275/275014.png?modified=1668096516","width":764,"height":540,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/275/275014.jpg?modified=1668096516","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":377,"caption":"Overview"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/275/275015.png?modified=1668096516","width":415,"height":576,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/275/275015.jpg?modified=1668096516","thumbnailWidth":288,"thumbnailHeight":400,"caption":"Tab context menu compatible to Firefox's native one"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/275/275013.png?modified=1668096516","width":284,"height":372,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/275/275013.jpg?modified=1668096516","thumbnailWidth":284,"thumbnailHeight":372,"caption":"Drag and drop to manage tree"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/275/275012.png?modified=1668096516","width":219,"height":223,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/275/275012.jpg?modified=1668096516","thumbnailWidth":219,"thumbnailHeight":223,"caption":"Long-press on the new tab button shows the container chooser"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/275/275016.png?modified=1668096516","width":226,"height":186,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/275/275016.jpg?modified=1668096516","thumbnailWidth":226,"thumbnailHeight":186,"caption":"Right-edge of the new tab button shows the new tab position chooser"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/275/275017.png?modified=1668096516","width":648,"height":567,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/275/275017.jpg?modified=1668096516","thumbnailWidth":457,"thumbnailHeight":400,"caption":"Various built-in theme"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/237/237255.png?modified=1668096516","width":467,"height":350,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/237/237255.jpg?modified=1668096516","thumbnailWidth":467,"thumbnailHeight":350,"caption":"\"Save bookmark\" dialog"}],"contributionURL":"","averageRating":4.5341,"reviewCount":862,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tree-style-tab/reviews/","updateDate":1731939799000},{"id":"{7a7a4a92-a2a0-41d1-9fd7-1e92480d612d}","icons":{"32":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/814/814814-32.png?modified=1542603952","64":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/814/814814-64.png?modified=1542603952","128":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/814/814814-128.png?modified=1542603952"},"name":"Stylus","version":"1.5.51","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/4338993/styl_us-1.5.51.xpi","homepageURL":"https://add0n.com/stylus.html","supportURL":"https://github.com/openstyles/stylus/issues","amoListingURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/","description":"Redesign your favorite websites with Stylus, an actively developed and community driven userstyles manager.

As you can see in WebExtensions API documentation or simplified tutorials, there's no way to apply any modifications to a web page without gaining the full access permission to that page. Stylus is mostly used to apply global themes, which is why it requests a global permission. In the future we might be able to implement a more granular approach but it's not exactly trivial.\n\n    Access your data for all websites - required for the style elements to be added into the page, not to access any of your data.\n    Access browser tabs - required to show styles in the popup, and for some auxiliary features like regexp tester in the editor.\n    Access browser activity during navigation - required to insert the styles at the exact moment the page is navigated to a different URL.\n    Identity - required for access to cloud services to allow importing and exporting of styles (e.g. Dropbox, etc).\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nUnlike other similar extensions, we don't find you to be all that interesting. Your questionable browsing history should remain between you and the NSA. Stylus collects nothing. Period.\n\n\nFirefox related notes\n\n    To import styles from Stylish add-on please read https://github.com/openstyles/stylus/wiki/FAQ#how-can-i-export-my-user-styles-from-stylish-for-firefox-to-stylus\n    Stylus doesn't apply userstyles to the browser UI or the built-in pages like about:addons because there's no WebExtension API for dynamic application of CSS. You may use another extension that runs an externally installed companion utility to modify userChrome.css and userContent.css and restart Firefox. This restriction is imposed intentionally by Mozilla for security purposes. We don't plan to incorporate the above-mentioned workaround. See https://github.com/openstyles/stylus/wiki/Styling-Firefox-UI\n    Export backups of your database frequently. The main reason we've kept the \"beta\" status for so long is because WebExtension support is still a work in progress for Firefox. Many Firefox specific workarounds have been implemented, but backing up your DB regularly will save you a lot of aggravation should something happen to go wrong.","weeklyDownloads":7247,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"Stylus Team","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/13438734/"},"developers":[{"name":"Jeremy Schomery","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/11568224/"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/184/184539.png?modified=1622132703","width":700,"height":517,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/184/184539.jpg?modified=1622132703","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":394,"caption":"Promo"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/184/184538.png?modified=1622132703","width":700,"height":438,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/184/184538.jpg?modified=1622132703","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":334,"caption":"Editor"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/200/200986.png?modified=1622132705","width":843,"height":597,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/200/200986.jpg?modified=1622132705","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":377,"caption":"Manager - customizing a usercss style"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/200/200987.png?modified=1622132709","width":970,"height":865,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/200/200987.jpg?modified=1622132709","thumbnailWidth":449,"thumbnailHeight":400,"caption":"Editor - showing RegExp tester and colorpicker"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/200/200985.png?modified=1622132711","width":538,"height":610,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/200/200985.jpg?modified=1622132711","thumbnailWidth":353,"thumbnailHeight":400,"caption":"Popup - customizing a usercss style"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/200/200988.png?modified=1622132713","width":576,"height":727,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/200/200988.jpg?modified=1622132713","thumbnailWidth":317,"thumbnailHeight":400,"caption":"Popup - finding styles"}],"contributionURL":"","averageRating":4.6773,"reviewCount":335,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/reviews/","updateDate":1724320359000},{"id":"extension@tabliss.io","icons":{"32":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/850/850407-32.png?modified=1650892013","64":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/850/850407-64.png?modified=1650892013","128":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/850/850407-128.png?modified=1650892013"},"name":"Tabliss - New Tab","version":"2.6.0","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/3940751/tabliss-2.6.0.xpi","homepageURL":"https://tabliss.io","supportURL":"https://tabliss.io/support.html","amoListingURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tabliss/","description":"A beautiful New Tab page with many customisable backgrounds and widgets that does not require any permissions.","fullDescription":"Transform your new tab page to something beautiful and yours.
